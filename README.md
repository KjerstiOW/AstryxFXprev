# AstryxFX

A desktop application for automated esports statistics, built with JavaFX, Discord4J, and Python.

## Overview

Astryx is a Discord bot combined with an API and SQL manager, GUI input, and statistics creator.
The application automatically updates a master database of matches, maps, vetoes, and statistics every 15 minutes, or on-demand using the program commands.

The Discord bot allows teams to retrieve statistics.
For instance, a team may want statistics on an opponent for various strategic decisions.
Since this process is fully automated, there is no middleman and each team gets the up-to-date statistics immediately.

## Components
### Desktop GUI
A JavaFX interface built with FXML and CSS that lets users manage bot behaviour without writing or restarting code.
Has numerous features, such as autocomplete.

### Discord Bot Control
Connects to a Discord bot using Discord4J's reactive API, handling events and interactions.

### Annotations and Reflections
Easily usable annotations makes it easy to define bot commands and program commands.

### SQL Manager
Stores settings and records in a MySQL database via the official MySQL Connector/J.

### External API Integration
Makes outbound HTTP requests using OkHttp, with JSON responses handled through Jackson and org.json

### Configuration
Bot and application settings are managed through readable TOML config files

### Logging
Uses Log4j2 with SLF4J bridging to produce structured logs, stored in a dedicated logs directory

### Python
We create the charts sent using the Discord commands using matplotlib.
